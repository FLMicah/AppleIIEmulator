# AppleIIEmulator
A Java emulator for the Apple II in the Project863 Universe!

I made this program as a small project for my coding class in high school - as we are just starting out with Java. This bit of Java code will run to emulate the emulator used with the Apple II in season 1 of Project863. 
  Feel free to poke around, look at it, or use it in any way you would like!

There is a password backdoor that I set up so that I wouldn't have to type in the long string of characters every time while I tested the program, it's "Spire".

Prereqs:
  - The latest version of Java: https://www.java.com/en/download/
  - A way to run a Java program (Preferably Command Prompt for Windows or the Terminal app on Macs)

I tried to make it the most realistic as I could, which is why in the chat logs the characters don't extend out to a certain space. As of now the only directory
  that is set up is the Pegasus directory.
