# AppleIIEmulator
A Java emulator for the Apple II in the Project863 Universe!

This bit of Java code will run to emulate the emulator used with the Apple II in season 1 of Project863. 
  Feel free to poke around, look at it, or use it in any way you would like!

There is a password backdoor that I set up so that I wouldn't have to type in the long string of characters while I tested the program, it's "Spire".

Have fun!
