# AppleIIEmulator
A Java emulator for the Apple II in the Project863 Universe!

I made this program for my beginning project for my coding class in high school - as we are just starting out with Java. This bit of Java code will run to emulate the emulator used with the Apple II in season 1 of Spellbound's Project863. 
  Feel free to poke around, look at it, or use it in any way you would like!

There is a password backdoor that I set up so that I wouldn't have to type in the long string of characters every time while I tested the program, it's "Spire". So if you
  want to make it a bit easier, just enter that when it prompts you for a password. The original string "VZ$JK$MEDZ5AT" still works, though. 

Prereqs:
  - The latest version of Java: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
  - A way to run a Jar (Preferably Command Prompt for Windows or the Terminal app on Macs)

To run on Windows:
  1. Enter into a new command prompt by going to the start menu and typing in "cmd" (exclude quotes).
  2. Now, specify the location of the jar file. So, if you downloaded the jar, type in "cd downloads" into the console and hit enter.
  3. To run the jar, type in "java -jar appleiiemulator.jar" and hit enter, and that's it! You should see a left open bracket followed by the prompt "Username:".

To run on Mac: 
  1. In the launchpad on the dock, type "terminal" and hit return/enter. A new terminal window should open.
  2. Specify the location of the jar file. So, if you downloaded the jar, type in "cd downloads" into the console and hit return/enter.
  3. To run the jar, type in "java -jar appleiiemulator.jar" and hit enter, and again that's it!

I tried to make it the most realistic as I could, which is why in the chat logs the characters don't extend out to a certain space. As of now the only directory
  that is set up is the Pegasus directory.
  
By the way, I'm really new to programming and Java! Please feel free to recommend tips for this project or let me know if there's an issue on the repo on Github!
